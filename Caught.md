# What to do if you are caught

## In the street or public space
It is a public space, so don't hesitate to shout for help.
The most effective shout is "Rape, Help, He is trying to kidnap me."
Most people are ashamed of the view of the public, and the risk. So this might give you the seconds you need to escape. 
You can also kick his/her foot so they will focus on the pain. 
There might be some people coming to your help but you should not count on that. 

Also, you can try to learn some self defence moves. There are lots of videos on youtube about that.

You will have to train those moves until you know them and can use them without having to think about it.
And they will be a life long skill, so you should consider that as an investment.

__If they are several__ don't try to fight they will hurt you. Try the shouting strategy and try to shake yourself life crazy.
And during that time try to call with fast calling someone that can help you.
(there are also apps on android against kidnaping.

## At work
Well if your office as security ask them to remove those people from the building. 
If they wait you outside, ask a friend to pick you up and ask security to escort you.
Or if you are in a legal situation that allows you that, call the police.
