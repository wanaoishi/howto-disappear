I have created this guide as I have seen this problem happening quite a lot. As such, I looked at what would be good solutions for escaping an abusive relationship.


> The solutions listed are just some of the potential solutions existing and they also are not exhaustive. As such, if anyone has proposals for modifications or addons, please use the pull request or message me.

## Disappear digitally
- No use of social media for the period. 
- Remove location to all WA, Line, Messenger, ...

	### Phone
	
	Best way is to have a new phone, with new SIM card as you can’t trust the devices that have been in your parents reach.
	This new phone, should be hidden from the parents at all time.
	The new SIM card should be bought under an other name, (Example parents of a friend or friend) but not the boyfriend or his familly as this is the first name they will check if they search for the number.
	
	If you can’t change the phone follow the described steps.
	
	#### If Android
	- Remove the SD Card and don’t use this one. Buy a new one but don’t put it in the phone until you did everything listed here.
	- Save your photos and contacts to your hard drive.
	- Create a new google account. But this account should be created with a computer in a Cyber coffee or a friend computer, that has no link to the families. Also during the creation of this account, don’t use your normal email or phone as recovery, don’t use your name, and never send email from your normal personal / work email to this one. Use it exclusively for setting up that phone. If you need to transfer emails to this, use a third party email as a proxy. (Normal Email -> Proxy Email -> New email) Proxy could be a trusted friend email or a temporary email service such as https://www.guerrillamail.com/
	- If you know how to do it the best would be to completely reinstall the phone ROM. (Some shops also can do it for you). Otherwise do a factory reset of the phone.
	- Now use the new email to setup the phone 
	- Put the new SD card
	- Turn off GPS when not needed.
	- Create a new GOJEK/Grab accounts. And never send money to them from your account, or previous gojek account. 
	- Do not install Facebook, instagram, or any social media previously used.
	- Install WhatsApp or any communication software needed but not facebook messenger. 
	- In settings > Privacy block the localisation for all communication softwares, to ensure not to be tracked.
	- The best would be to create new communication accounts (WA, Line, ...) to ensure you control who can find you on those accounts.
	
	!!!!! WARNINGS !!!!!!
	- Do not publish on social media, any public website or send to your family photos taken from your phone as they contain your localisation. 

	#### If Iphone
	Steps are the same, without the SD card part. 
	You can directly do the factory reset. 
	And you need new ICloud account.
	
	
	### Laptop or any type computer
	If it has staid at your parent place and you even for 10 minutes haven’t been close it, threat it as a spying device. You never know what they could have installed on it.
	
	#### If it is a work laptop
	Ask your IT to do a virus check and réinstallation of it.
	They should have the proper tools.
	
	#### If windows laptop
	Consider it difficult to clean. 
	The best way is a full formatting and reinstall of the PC.
	(Can be done by a shop if not able to do it yourself)
	But I would consider just letting that laptop at the parents home, and just backup on an external drive all necessary informations.
	
	#### If Mac
	Go to recovery mode (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255) and do a clean installation. You will lose all your data on the hard drive so had a backup done before. 
	DO NOT USE TIME MACHINE TO BACKUP OR RESTORE
	DO NOT USE THE OLD ICLOUD ACCOUNT TO SETUP, USE A NEW ONE CREATED BEFORE IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE.
	
	### External Hard-Drives
	
	Threat any external hard drive as a potential attack vector for your computer.
	As such you should do a virus scan of those disks.
	The virus scans should be done on an other machine. Preferably a cyber coffee shop. 
	If the coffee shop doesn’t have an antivirus you can use the following:

	If you don’t have a cyber coffee, use a computer that can be offline and which already have an up to date antivirus. 
		- Update the antivirus and database
		- If you don’t have an antivirus, use this: https://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download
		- When the antivirus is installed and updated put your computer offline.
		- Plug the hard drive in 
		- And launch a full virus scan of the hard drive

	##### Data backup
	After you backup any data to your hard drive from a not trusted source, do the virus check steps again before connecting it to the laptop we just secured.



	###	Access your old accounts
	First, you should preferably do it from a cyber coffee. And on that there is some rules: Don’t go to the same each time, don’t give them your real identity, and don’t take one close to where you live or work.
	
	If you have to do it from your laptops here are the rules.
	Install a VPN and turn it on. You can use https://1.1.1.1/ it is free and works nearly everywhere in the world.
	Use incognito mode with a browser like Firefox, that you have installed and setup following this setup guide (https://proprivacy.com/privacy-service/guides/firefox-privacy-security-guide) 
	
	 
If you follow the previous steps you should be on the clear
